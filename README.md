# VR on Mac

Welcome to **vr-on-mac**! This project is all about getting Virtual Reality to work on ARM-based Macs (M1/M2/M3 and beyond). We're focusing primarily on standalone headsets like the **Meta Quest** and **Pico**.

## Intel Mac Users

If you’re on an Intel Mac and you really want VR (and I mean really want it), the best thing you can do is boot into Windows using Bootcamp. It’s the most stable solution for desktop headsets because Windows has the right drivers and the proper support for all the extra connections these headsets demand.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What headsets are supported?

- **Meta Quest 2 / Quest 3**
- ** Pico Neo 3 / 4** (not of main focus)
- Other standalone headsets that support wireless connections should also work, but the above are the main focus as of right now.

### Can I use desktop VR headsets (e.g., Valve Index, HTC Vive)?

Not on ARM Macs, sorry. The hardware just doesn’t play nice with the extra connections required by desktop headsets (like DisplayPort and HDMI). 

### Can I run this on an Intel Mac?

Sure, but you're better off using Bootcamp to run Windows. It's a much smoother experience for traditional desktop headsets. 

### What about performance on ARM Macs?

In my recent testing, so far not the best (on the base M3 Pro). However, I am hoping to improve performance in the future.
